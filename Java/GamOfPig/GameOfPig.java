/***************************************************************************************
 * For Assignment #4    
 * Name: Ngoc Thinh Nguyen
 *Program name: GameOfPig.java
 *Program objects: Focus on If/Else,While loops, and Methods 
 *Program Desciption: - This propram request user play the game against the computer 
 *                      using one dice. Using the Random method to generate the simulate
 *                      a 6 side die. 
 *                    - The player play first, they can choose to end their turn 
 *                       or her or his is ended when they roll a 1. the user must make a 
 *                       agreement whenever they would like to roll again. if they roll  
 *                       a 1, they loose all point in the round they are playing.
 *                    - The computer can end its turn when it rolls a 1 or it has already 
 *                      done four rolls in a round. Like the player, the computer 
 *                      is looses all its points on the playing round if it rolls a 1
 *                    
 * program input: Use a single random object to simulate the roll of dice. That means 
 *                 we can have a random number between 1 to 6.               
 *                 The user need to answer the question "Do you want to roll again?"
 *                 whenever they want to roll again
 * program output: The number of rolled each time the player and computer roll. Total  
 *                 earn and end of each turn. the cumulative score at the end of each 
 *                  turn, and whether the player or computer won or lost the game.
 *                  once a score of at least 100 is reached
 * Due: Friday October 24, 8 pm
